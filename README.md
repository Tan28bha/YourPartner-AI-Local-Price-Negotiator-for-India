# 🧠 Problem Statement

In India’s highly unstructured local markets, price transparency is extremely poor. Everyday consumers — especially students, migrants, and tourists — frequently face:

* 🚕 Auto and local transport overcharging
* 🛒 Street vendors quoting inconsistent prices
* 🧳 Tourists being charged premium “outsider” rates
* 🔧 Local service providers giving arbitrary quotes
* 🤷 Lack of reliable reference pricing in real time

This creates **financial leakage, mistrust, and poor consumer confidence** in local commerce.

Despite the rise of digital payments, **offline price intelligence remains broken**.

**Output includes:**

* Minimum fair price
* Maximum fair price
* Confidence score

✅ Core value engine.

## 2️⃣ Overcharge Detection Engine

Users can optionally enter the quoted price. The AI classifies the quote as:

## 3️⃣ Smart Negotiation Assistant (Viral Feature)

The AI generates **context-aware negotiation scripts** in the user’s preferred language and tone.

This removes social friction and empowers even shy users.

---

## 4️⃣ Voice-First Interaction (India-Optimized)

Users can speak naturally in Hindi/English (expandable to regional languages).

Example:

> “Auto from Marathahalli to Whitefield kitna hona chahiye?”

This makes the product accessible to **non-tech and semi-literate users**.
