# 🧠 Problem Statement

In India’s highly unstructured local markets, price transparency is extremely poor. Everyday consumers — especially students, migrants, and tourists — frequently face:

* 🚕 Auto and local transport overcharging
* 🛒 Street vendors quoting inconsistent prices
* 🧳 Tourists being charged premium “outsider” rates
* 🔧 Local service providers giving arbitrary quotes
* 🤷 Lack of reliable reference pricing in real time

This creates **financial leakage, mistrust, and poor consumer confidence** in local commerce.

Despite the rise of digital payments, **offline price intelligence remains broken**.
